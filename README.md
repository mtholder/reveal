# Reveal-based slides by Mark T. Holder

The slides written by Mark Holder are open source. See the [LICENSE-for-slides](./LICENSE-for-slides)
file, but not the *caveat* that some images were created by others (and used by Mark Holder
with permission from those authors).

The [gh-pages](https://github.com/mtholder/reveal/tree/gh-pages) branch of 
this repo is deployed to https://mtholder.github.io/reveal/

Images from papers are in the images directory. Filenames gives an
abbreviation of the reference. Grepping the source files for usage of 
that image links to the publication.

This repos was created by forking the reveal.js repo. README for that follows...

## Online Editor

Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at [https://slides.com](https://slides.com?ref=github).


## Instructions

### Markup

Here's a barebones example of a fully working reveal.js presentation:
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reveal.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme/white.css">
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="reveal">
			<div class="slides">
				<section>Slide 1</section>
				<section>Slide 2</section>
			</div>
		</div>
		<script src="js/reveal.js"></script>
		<script>
			Reveal.initialize();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

The presentation markup hierarchy needs to be `.reveal > .slides > section` where the `section` represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple `section` elements inside of another `section` they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the "root" of the others (at the top), and will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example:

```html
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://revealjs.com">
  <img src="https://hakim-static.s3.amazonaws.com/reveal-js/logo/v1/reveal-black-text-sticker.png" alt="reveal.js" width="500">
  </a>
  <br><br>
  <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/actions"><img src="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/workflows/tests/badge.svg"></a>
  <a href="https://slides.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/images/slides-github-banner-320x40.png?1" alt="Slides" width="160" height="20"></a>
</p>
```
