### Using all data

Cons:
  * Can create long branches by lack of data for some tips or
     increasing the size of tree
  * Poor data overlap between taxa can lead to rogue taxa and terraces

Pros:
  * Uses all the data
  * Helps you spot the weakness in your phylogenetic argument



### Conclusions

  * Readers want to know how your phylogenetic model fits with all available data
  * More convincing to present full data, and **interrogate** analyses for causes of incongruence

and now the *caveats*...



## Interaction effects

  * Missing data × model misspecification
  * Missing data × model partitioning
  * Missing data × tree depth
  * Missing data × ascertainment biases
