### Using all data

Cons:
  * Can create long branches by lack of data for some tips or
     increasing the size of tree
  * Poor data overlap between taxa can lead to rogue taxa and terraces

Pros:
  * Uses all the data
  * Helps you spot the weakness in your phylogenetic argument



### Conclusions

  * Readers want to know how your phylogenetic model fits with all available data
  * More convincing to present full data, and **interrogate** analyses for causes of incongruence

but the *caveats*...



## Interaction effects

  * Missing data × model misspecification
  * Missing data × model partitioning
  * Missing data × ascertainment biases
  * Missing data × tree depth



### Missing data × model misspecification

  * Our models of substitution are not good enough to deal with deep divergences.

Figure 2 from [Pisani *et al.* (2015)](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1518127112) results from
[PhyloBayes CAT model](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/People/lartillot/www/index.htm) analyses.



### Missing data × model misspecification

  * Both [Lemmon *et al.* (2009)](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/1/130) and
 [Roure *et al.* (2013)](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/197.abstract)
find that artificial data from 2 tips (or 1 tip) can mislead tree preferency by 
**contaminating parameter estimates**.
  * Conditions were contrived, but still indicates troubling lack of robustness.
